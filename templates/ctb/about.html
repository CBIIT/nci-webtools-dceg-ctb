                        The Chernobyl (Chornobyl in Ukrainian) Tissue Bank (CTB) is a repository of biological material
                        and data from patients with thyroid tumors who were exposed as children or adolescents to
                        radioactive fallout from the April 26, 1986, accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in
                        Ukraine. The CTB also houses a digital collection of data derived by researchers using our
                        samples.

                    <div class="mt-3">Since CTB was found in October 1998, the project has been supported by a number of
                        sponsors including the European Commission, the World Health Organization, the U.S. National
                        Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Sasakawa Health Foundation of Japan (SHF). At the time of its
                        founding, the CTB established a Coordinating Center at Imperial College, London, UK. In 2023,
                        the Coordinating Center moved to the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the NCI,
                        part of the National Institutes of Health, which now funds and coordinates the CTB in
                        collaboration with the V.P. Komisarenko Institute of Endocrinology (IEM) and Metabolism of the
                        National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine in Kiev, with the full support of the Government
                        of Ukraine. Initially, Belarus and Russia were included in the project, but those collaborations
                        are currently suspended for political reasons.

                    <div class="mt-3">
                        The objective of the CTB is to provide a research resource for studies of the health
                        consequences of the Chernobyl accident. It aims to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure that specimens of thyroid cancer removed on or after October 1, 1998, are
                                consistently described and sampled; that the materials (extracted tumor and normal
                                DNA/RNA, blood samples, and in some cases fixed tissue sections) along with the
                                demographic, clinical and pathological information, are available for appropriate
                                research studies; and that all specimens and data are collected and shared with
                                appropriate informed consent.
                            </li>
                            <li>Review tumor specimens and provide a consensus diagnosis by an international committee
                                of expert pathologists for all cases. Diagnostic information is available to research
                                groups carrying out molecular biological, therapeutic, epidemiological, and other
                                studies.
                            </li>
                            <li>Maximize the amount of information obtained from small pieces of tumor and promote
                                collaborative, rather than competitive, research on a limited biological resource.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure that knowledge pertaining to the consequences of this accident may benefit the
                                patients affected and be of value in responding to future nuclear accidents as well as
                                in understanding and treating thyroid tumors more generally.
                            </li>

                        The tissue bank is located at the V.P. Komisarenko Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism
                        (IEM) in Kiev, Ukraine. The staff of the CTB obtains informed consent from patients and prepares
                        and stores their donated materials. (Historically, a separate tissue bank was also maintained in
                        Russia.) The CTB maintains a database of samples and data that are shared via an integrated
                        database managed by the coordinating center. The CTB staff work closely with the coordinating
                        center staff who make key information available to researchers wishing to access the material.

                        DNA/RNA and blood samples). The CTB has in place a robust security system to protect patient
                        privacy while ensuring their valuable information is available for research studies.

                        The CTB currently includes material and information from patients with thyroid carcinomas and
                        cellular follicular adenomas from the contaminated oblasts of Ukraine (Kiev, Kiev city,
                        Cherkasse, Chernigov, Rovno, Zhitomyr and Sumy) who were born after April 26, 1967, (i.e.,
                        younger than 19 years of age at the time of the Chernobyl accident), were treated with surgery
                        on or after October 1,1998, at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism in Kiev, Ukraine,
                        and who consent to donate to the project. The CTB also includes patients who were born after the
                        accident, and thus were not exposed to radioactive iodine, as a comparison.
                    </div>
                    <div class="mt-3">The CTB collects a variety of biospecimen from patients undergoing operations for
                        thyroid
                        cancer or adenoma. Tissue collection follows an approved standard operating procedure (SOP) and
                        is snap frozen whenever possible; the presence or absence of tumor is verified by frozen
                        section. A representative paraffin block is also obtained for each case. Where appropriate, the
                        CTB also collects fresh and paraffin-embedded tissue from loco-regional metastases.
                    </div>
                    <div class="mt-3">Histological slides from all tumors are reviewed by the CTB Pathology Panel, an
                        international
                        group of expert thyroid pathologists, and a consensus diagnosis agreed before any materials are
                        released to researchers.

                    <div class="mt-3">Available samples include frozen aliquots of DNA and RNA extracted from normal and
                        neoplastic
                        thyroid tissue and DNA extracted from blood. A frozen section is taken from each portion of
                        tissue before extraction to verify its nature. Quality control is performed on nucleic acid
                        extracted from all tissues and blood samples. In addition, paraffin sections and tissue
                        microarrays are available. Researchers who request access to samples are provided with extracted
                        nucleic acid from thyroid tissue, rather than a small piece of tissue. This maximizes the amount
                        of data that can potentially be obtained from a single specimen and enables multiple molecular
                        biological studies to be carried out for each case. Aliquots of serum are also available.

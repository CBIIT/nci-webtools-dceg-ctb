                        applications for use of the bank are referred to an independent External Review Panel, which
                        comprises experts nominated by the organisations which sponsor the project - the National Cancer
                        Institute of the USA (NCI), and Sasakawa Health Foundation of Japan (SHF) - and the governments
                        of the participating Eastern European countries (Ukraine and Russia).</p>
                    <p>An overview of the application review procedure is provided in the flow diagram below. Details of
                        the review procedure and of the criteria on which an application will be evaluated are given in
                        the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="{% url 'fact_sheet' %}" target="_blank"

                    <p>Distribution of materials to a Principal Investigator whose project has been approved will be
                        authorised subject to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>receipt of a signed agreement from the Principal Investigator to conform to the conditions

                        </li>
                        <li>modification of the number and size of samples required dependent on any amendments by the
                            External Review Panel and the availability of the material.

                    <p>Each sample of nucleic acid or serum will be identified by a CTB sample number and accompanied by
                        a minimum data set comprising the following information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>age at accident - complying with HIPAA regulations</li>
                        <li>age at operation - complying with HIPAA regulations</li>
                        <li>sex</li>
                        <li>oblast of residence</li>

                        <li>Estimated thyroid radiation dose (if requested by the researcher).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If a project requires more clinical information than the minimum data set, this must be stated
                        clearly in the application, particularly if this is an essential component of the project. Any
                        such project will normally be carried out as a collaboration with the Eastern European institute
                        involved in collections of the samples and, where appropriate, approval of the relevant Ethical
                        Committee must be sought.</p>
                    <p>Where possible, material for a given project will be provided in one batch, however, in some
                        cases, provision may have to be made over a period of time.</p>

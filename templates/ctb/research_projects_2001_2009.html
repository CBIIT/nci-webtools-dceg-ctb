    <p class="bodytext"><em>Expression profiling of tyrosine kinase genes in malignant tumors of the
        thyroid gland.<br><br></em>Summary of project:<br><br>Abnormal expression of tyrosine kinase (tk)
        genes is a common phenomenon in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), where it is believed to alter
        cell growth and response to external signals such as growth factors, hormones etc. While the
        pathogenesis of radiation-induced PTC remains unclear, there is evidence that tk genes such as the
        receptor tyrosine kinases ret and NTRK-1 are abnormally expressed, and that the overexpression of
        some tk genes due to gene amplification or changes in gene regulation in the absence of structural
        alterations may lead to oncogenic transformation of cells. Using a DNA microarray based technique,
        we have identified several tk genes with abnormal expression in human tumor cell lines. We now
        propose to apply the technique to measure the relative expression levels of more than 50 tk genes in
        the PTC's that arose after the Chernobyl nuclear accident and to compare these expression profiles
        with the gene expression pattern found in sporadic PTC cases and tumors that arose following low
        level therapeutic irradiation of the thyroid. Results from this study may allow the identification
        of molecular markers that can be used to facilitate tumor diagnosis and staging, and, eventually,
        provide targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

        investigate the link between exposure of children to radiation, the subsequent development of
        tumors and how their morphology, molecular and cell biology influence clinical outcome. The project
        is an integrated approach involving 5 leading European centers. Samples of the same tumors will be
        studied by the 5 different centers to determibe tumor morphology and type; the degree of variation
        within the tumor, including the variation of the proportion of cells in cycle using antibodies to
        novel DNA replication associated peptides; the gene involved in the carcinogenic process, using DNA
        chip technology; specific studies of the pathways associated with one oncogene (ret) known to be
        linked to the tumor type involved; and studies of novel gene rearrangements using FISH technology.
        By using the same tumor/normal pairs in these studies, integrating the results from the different
        centers and studies and correlating these with detailed morphological analysis and patient details
        including evidence on tumor aggressiveness and recurrence, we will increase our understanding of
        the link between radiation exposure and cancer development, and provide evidence which will inform
        decisions on radiation protection and on clinical management of patients with radiation associated
        cancers.</p>

        developed after the Chernobyl accident.<br><br></em>Summary of project:<br><br>The papillary thyroid
        carcinoma oncogene (RET/PTC) is a rearranged version of the tyrosine kinase RET. It is know that the
        incidence of RET/PTC activation is increased in radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinomas
        compared to papillary thyroid carcinomas without a radiation history. The prognostic value of
        RET/PTC rearrangements and its importance as a radiation-specific marker is still unclear. It is
        proposed to screen 70 childhood cases from Belarus and Ukraine with interphase FISH in conjunction
        with RT-PCR to confirm the presence and type of the chimeric transcripts. Cases with indications for
        atypical RET/PTC rearrangements will be further investigated using 5'RACE for the presence of novel
        types of alteration. For this part of the proposal RNA samples as well as a limited number of
        paraffin-embedded sections would be needed. The RNA samples will be further investigated for
        expression profiles of other tyrosine kinase genes to identify other gene rearrangements which may

        DNA deletions and mutations in post Chernobyl thyroid tumors and in the respective normal thyroid
        parenchyma.<br><br></em>Summary of project:<br><br>Mittochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a likely hotspot
        for mutation in cancer as it is preferentially modified by many carcinogens. We have previously
        shown that there is a specific association between sequence variants of Complex I genes and ATPase6,
        one of the two mitochondrial genes of Complex V, and the occurrence of malignancy and of oxyphil
        features in thyroid tumors. We have also found a significant association between mitochondrial
        sequence variants and the occurrence (and degree) of the so-called mitochondrial common deletion. In
        an attempt to elucidate the role of post-Chernobyl irradiation in mtDNA alterations and to find out
        whether or not such alterations are involved in the etiopathogenesis of thyroid tumors we will
        search for the mtDNA common deletion and for somatic mutations and sequence variants in the D-loop
        region, in the 13 coding genes and in the 22 tRNAs genes of cases from which there are RNA and DNA
        samples extracted from blood (set without radiation), normal thyroid (set irradiation) and tumors
        (set irradiation and tumorigenesis). In a first step, we will study exhaustively 20 cases. The
        results obtained in this first part will be used together with the data we and others have
        previously obtained to decide the most appropriate targets for the second part of the study. If
        possible we would like to correlate the results of our study on mtDNA deletions and mutations with
        those on ret oncogene. In case there are also clinico-pathyological data available, we would like to
        collaborate with the pathologists who have studied the cases in order to clarify the putative
        clinical significance of the mtDNA alterations.</p>

        proto-oncogene play a critical role in the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinomas both
        naturally occurring and radiation induced. We have recently found that classical RET/PTC
        rearrangements are present also in benign thyroid nodular disease. Furthermore, in several cases the
        independent expression of tyrosine kinase (TK) and extracellular (EC) domains of RET was found. This
        finding may be interpreted as RET wild type gene expression. In other cases, especially radiation
        exposed, the TK domain in the absence of EC was found and was interpreted as unknown RET/PTC
        rearrangements (PTCX). Aim of this project is to clarify the modality of expression of RET
        protooncogene in nodular thyroid diseases. In cases with EC and TK expression, we will search for
        RET wild type by an extralong PCR encompassing the TK and EC domains, followed by sequencing of the
        PCR product. In cases of TK positive expression only (but not classical PTC1, PTC2 and PTC3) we will

        quantitative PCR (ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector, Perkin Elmer) for TK mRNA. The TK mRNA

        phenotype with a block of the differentiation program, hormone-independent proliferation and
        increased apoptotic rate. Oligonucleotide GeneChips were used to analyse gene expression profiles of
        PC Cl 3 cells expressing either RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 oncogenes in comparison to parental cells.
        About 2,000 genes showing at least two-fold increase and 2,000 genes showing at least two-fold
        decrease were identified in RET/PTC-expressing thyrocytes. Virtually all the genes up-regulated by
        more than 5-folds (about 100) were confirmed by RT-PCR and some of them by immunoblot. Genes
        upregulated by RET/PTC could be functionally divided in genes involved in proliferation (such as
        D-type cyclins), apoptosis, proteolysis, inflammation, and metabolism. We plan to extend these
        studies on the identified genes up and on the downregulated by analyzing their expression in human
        thyroid tumors of different histotypes. We propose to study their expression by semiquantitative
        reverse transcriptase PCR and for selected genes by real time quantitative PCR. Immunohistochemical
        analysis will be use to verify protein expression.<br><br>The findings of these studies can reveal

            Comprehensive Molecular Profile of ChildhoodRadiation Induced Papillary Thyroid Tumors Compared
            to Adult Sporadic Papillary Tumors<br><br></em>Summary of project<strong>:<br><br></strong>Papillary
        thyroid carcinoma (PTC) accounts for 80% of all thyroid malignancies. It has a variable disease
        course and to date no pathways or specific genes have been implicated as causative in this tumor.
        RET activation, through translocations involving several genes, have been noted in a high incidence
        of PTCs. However, the activation of this oncogene is found at all stages from benign through
        well-differentiated to undifferentiated carcinoma. This suggests that it represents an early event
        and that this defect is not in itself sufficient for carcinogenesis. It may also suggest that the
        classification of PTC covers more than one tumor subtype. The relationship between radiation
        exposure and PTC is well established. We plan to perform a genome wide scan using microarray
        analysis for alterations in tumors from children exposed to radiation and compare them to sporadic
        adult tumors to identify which genes are commonly altered and which genes are display differential
        alteration expression patterns. We plan to extend this study using high-resolution BAC-CGH to define
        a molecular pattern for these tumors and evaluate this approach for diagnostic applications. The
        study of molecular alterations which cause thyroid carcinoma is of importance since the
        identification of causative factors could lead to new approaches for treatment.</p>

        the Bryansk Oblast of the Russian Federation, who were 0-50 years of age at the time of exposure to
        radiation from the Chernobyl Power Station accident (ATA) on April 26, 1986. The study has three
        primary purposes: 1) to characterize cases of thyroid cancer according to specific molecular markers
        of genetic change, and investigate whether the presence of such markers is associated with
        individual thyroid radiation dose from the Chernobyl accident; 2) to investigate whether
        age-at-exposure dependent radiation dose response for thyroid cancer differs between cancers that
        are positive versus negative for the molecular markers investigated; and 3) to investigate whether
        the presence of these same molecular markers is associated with clinical outcomes. Included will be
        thyroid cancer cases diagnosed between April 1, 2001 and March 31, 2006 and confirmed by a panel of
        expert thyroid pathologists. An equal number of controls will be individually matched to cases by
        sex, age, type of settlement and raion of residence on April 26, 1986. Data collected will include
        in-person interviews for all participants, and for cases only, paraffin embedded tissue or fresh

            Genetic and Epigenetic Abnormalities in Radiation-induced Thyroid Cancers<br><br></em>Project
        Summary:<br><br>Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine malignancies and the vast majority of
        them are papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). Several genetic abnormalities, including <em>Ras </em>mutations
        and <em>RET/PTC </em>rearrangements have been well characterized in these cancers. Recently, we and
        several other groups have reported the <em>BRAF </em>mutation in PTC with a high prevalence. We have
        also characterized aberrant DNA methylation in several genes in thyroid cancers, including novel
        tumor suppressor genes and some thyroid-specific genes. Except for the <em>RET/PCT </em>rearrangements,
        these genetic and epigenetic abnormalities have been studied mainly in sporadic thyroid cancers, and
        their role is unknown in the special group of thyroid cancers induced by radiation, the most common
        and well-established environmental risk factor for thyroid cancer. Chernobyl nuclear accident has
        been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of PTC, which represent an ideal
        thyroid tumor model for the study of radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis. In the present
        project, we propose to use such special thyroid cancer samples to study novel genetic and epigenetic
        abnormalities, their relationship, and their effects on the expression of key thyroid genes.
        Well-established experimental protocols and techniques, including RT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR,
        real-time quantitative PCR, and a recently established colorimetric mutation detection method will
        be used. The study is expected to result in important insights into radiation-induced thyroid
        tumorigenesis and provide novel clinical implications for this special group of thyroid cancers.</p>

            of molecular genetic abnormalities associated with progression of human thyroid follicular
            neoplasms<br><br></em>Project Summary:<br><br>Thyroid follicular carcinomas frequently exhibit
        RAS mutation, and closely resemble benign follicular adenomas with respect to morphology and
        differentiation. Cell culture studies suggest that at least one requirement for progression from an
        adenoma to a carcinoma is failure of an intrinsic mechanism that normally limits the proliferative
        lifespan of RAS-induced cell clones. One current candidate for over-riding the mechanism is the
        tumor suppressor gene p16 INK4a.<br><br>There is great clinical interest in this area, as currently
        there is no marker to distinguish between thyroid follicular adenoma and carcinoma when evaluating
        fine needle aspirates and biopsies of thyroid glands. This means that many people have unnecessary
        operations on the basis of presumed malignancy. We now therefore wish to carry out a comprehensive
        comparison between thyroid carcinoma and adenoma cells to identify differences that may confer an
        extended proliferative lifespan on carcinoma cells.</p>

        Expression in Chernobyl Thyroid Cancers<br><br></em>Project Summary:<br><br>Chernobyl thyroid
        cancers represent a unique resource in oncology and radiation biology. They appear in a cohort of
        patients irradiated at the same time and in which there is no doubt that the cancer originated from
        radiation exposure. The precise timing of the course allows to follow precisely the kinetics of
        appearance of the cancers. On the other hand study of the gene expression pattern of cancers by
        microarrays allows a precise molecular definition of each cancer. Using this methodology we were
        able to show that the clustering of gene patterns of Chernobyl cancers of the first wave and
        European and US sporadic cases could not separate them. This work should now be extended to a larger
        series of cases.<br><br>1) to try to distinguish subtypes of Chernobyl and sporadic papillary
        carcinomas and their signature.<br><br>2) to relate patterns of gene expression with clinical
        variables such as the duration of the incubation period and with the genetic diagnosis.<br><br>3) to
        validate data at the RNA level by PCR and at the protein level by Western and to define potential
        diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        Number in Thyroid Cancer.<br><br></em>Summary of project:<br><br>High copy-number gene amplification
        is known to take place at a few genomic loci in numerous human cancers, but widespread low-level
        copy-number changes in genomic DNA have not been described. cDNA microarray-based comparative genome
        hybridization yields high-resolution copy-number profiles that enable the detection of low-level
        amplification events at individual gene loci. We have shown in a small pilot study that pediatric
        thyroid carcinoma in residents of a region contaminated by 131I from the Chernobyl accident (the
        Bryansk Oblast) exhibits gene amplification at a higher frequency than that seen in pediatric
        thyroid carcinoma in US children with no history of radiation exposure. This result suggests that
        exposure to ionizing radiation from the environment may be associated with an increased rate of gene
        amplification in a human cancer. The consistent amplification of many genes among cases of
        post-Chernobyl thyroid carcinoma from Bryansk suggests the existence of a target pool of
        radiation-sensitive genomic loci that respond to exposure by initiating local amplification events.
        The pattern of gene amplification may represent a radiation signature that could be used to map
        amplicons likely to harbor participating oncogenes.<br><br>Based upon these differences observed in
        the pilot study in apparent gene amplification between post-Chernobyl and spontaneous pediatric
        papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), we hypothesize that radiation exposure leaves a measurable
        genomic signature in the form of stable changes in gene amplification. Some chromosomal regions
        identified by this method are likely to harbor participating oncogenes, but it is unreasonable to
        expect that so many genes be directly involved in oncogenesis. We hypothesize the presence of
        genomic hot spots in human DNA that are susceptible to radiation-induced amplification. These
        genomic targets are unlikely to be saturated by the doses of radiation delivered to these patients.
        The number of targets hit in each case should therefore be directly proportional to radiation dose.&nbsp;

        subject to correction by the caretaker systems of DNA repair. Our interest is in the role that these
        systems may play in the molecular pathogenesis of cancer. We propose a pilot project to assess the
        influence of genetic variation on cancer risk following exposure to ionising radiation. This will be
        achieved by investigation of variation in the genes involved in the DNA repair pathways, in DNA
        derived from blood samples or normal tissue samples from patients with thyroid tumors of
        radiation-associated and non-radiation-associated aetiology. There are two main justifications for
        such a study, first to identify SNPs which indicate possession of an at risk genotype, and secondly,
        to identify the genes in which genetic variation is a significant modulator of cancer risk. This has
        particular and wider relevance to the involvement of DNA repair-associated factors in the pathology
        of other cancers as well, such as breast cancer.<br><br>Genotyping of genes involved in
        double-strand break repair will be performed using a mass spectrometry-based SNPing platform which
        has been developed by our group at the University of Wales, Swansea. Data will be provided to the

        recurrent regions of amplifications and deletions and will be confirmed by interphase FISH on
        paraffin sections and further studies by PCR-based approaches to investigate expression of these
        genes. In a first pilot study it is intended to compare 10 RET/PTC-positive (RET/PTC3) and 10

        of project:<br><br>Gene expression has received less attention than the role of germline
        polymorphisms or somatic mutations in studies of radiation and thyroid cancer. The increase in
        papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) in exposed children following the Chernobyl nuclear accident
        presents an opportunity to pursue the role of gene expression further. Recently, we reported on
        expression of seven genes, each of which was able to distinguish post-Chernobyl PTCs from sporadic
        PTCs (Port et al 2007). Our approach involved (i) a whole genome microarray used for screening
        purposes; and (ii) quantitative examination of the 92 target genes with a high throughput RTQ-PCR
        technique (LDA). The study had some limitations such as the origin of sporadic PTCs (Eastern
        Germany), their different age at diagnosis and a small number of cases (n=11). Subsequently another
        group has reported on expression of thirteen genes involved in homologous recombination suggesting a
        distinct radiation pattern of post-Chernobyl PTCs (Detours et al 2007). Using the already
        established 2-stage design, the purpose of the present application is to overcome limitations in the
        previous study and extend the findings (Port et al 1007) by evaluating a dose-dependent gene

        well established risk factor for thyroid cancer. Ionising radiation is known to cause extensive DNA
        damage including double strand breaks, which may lead to the generation of somatic mutations in
        thyroid cells and cancer initiation. However, environmental triggers cannot fully explain the
        inter-patient heterogeneity in the individual response to exposure to radiation, which points to the
        existence of genetic variations that define the individual susceptibility to radiation-related
        cancer. We propose to analyse several candidate DNA repair genes and perform a genome-wide analysis
        of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Ukrainian patients who developed thyroid cancer after
        Chernobyl and in control cancer-free individuals to identify mutations and SNPs that are involved in
        genetic predisposition and to identify the genes that are affected. We will then perform functional
        analysis to find whether these genetic variations alter gene function. We will also study the link
        between specific SNPs and known or new mutations found in these tumors. The overall goal of this
        study is to identify genes involved in genetic predisposition to radiation-associated thyroid

        component of the thyroid is induced by external irradiation and by radionuclides deposited within
        the thyroid tissue. Estimates of the radiological risk of developing thyroid cancer are derived from
        epidemiological studies performed in. Populations receiving high doses where, according to Ron et
        al, the threshold in 100 mSv. Extrapolation of this risk to exposures at much lower doses is
        compromised by the lack of an accurate model of the dose response curve for thyroid cancer at low
        doses. Moreover, such population based estimates fail to take into account the contribution of
        individual genetic variability to the risk estimate. Individuals with an increased genetic
        predisposition to develop thyroid cancer are not identified, and it is precisely these individuals
        who will be at greatest risk at low doses. The GENRISK-T consortium is composed of thyroid cancer
        experts with experience in the fields of radiation biology, animal models of radiation-induced
        cancer, tumor banking, cancer biology, molecular genetics, histopathology, cyto genetics and risk
        modelling. We will use this interdisciplinary knowledge to define the genetic component influencing
        the risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer. This will be achieved through a combination of studies
        using animal models and in human radiation-induced thyroid tumors. This new understanding of the
        genetic risk modifiers will be used to develop an animal model of thyroid cancer that is responsive
        to low dose radiation in the cGy range, thereby providing an experimental solution to resolving the
        uncertainties of the low dose-response curve. This EC collaborative project (PI Professor M
        Atkinson, Helmholtz Zentrum, Munich) combines the use of animal models and human studies. This
        particular application is to support the investigation of human germline SNPs that may predispose to

            parallel paired-end sequencing</em><br><br>Summary of project:<br><br>Post-Chernobyl pediatric
        thyroid cancers are associated with a high frequency of recombination events leading to the
        generation of fusion oncogenes, resulting in aberrant expression and activation of RET, and less
        frequently of NTRK and BRAF. Altogether, ~60% of PTC arising in this patient population harbor one
        of these abnormalities. The discovery of novel somatic rearrangements using conventional methods has
        low sensitivity and/or resolution. We propose to use genome-wide parallel paired-end sequencing to
        identify somatic rearrangements in childhood thyroid cancers induced by radiation, as compared to
        age-matched thyroid cancers without radiation exposure. Altogether we will select 6 samples of each
        population: 2 with a known rearrangement in RET, NTRK or BRAF (as positive controls), and 4 without.
        We will construct 3kb insert Illumina libraries from each tumor DNA sample, and ~35bp of sequence
        from both ends of each fragment will be obtained. Each end will be mapped back to the reference
        genome. Fragments for which the ends do not map back within 3kb of each other and/or are in
        inappropriate orientation will be further studied as they may represent rearrangements present in
        the thyroid cancer genome. We will acquire ~1 fold genome coverage (~3Gb) from each sample. This
        will approximate to 30-fold physical coverage, allowing detection of essentially all rearrangements
        present in the dominant clone of the cancer. Rearrangements will be processed using a suite of
        informatics tools to predict which may generate an in-frame fusion gene. RNA from each of the
        samples will then be tested by exon-exon PCR to determine whether the fusion is expressed, and based
        on its predicted function, whether it may correspond to a driver mutation. The number of
        rearrangements in each cancer and their architecture will then be compared between the two classes.
        Sequences at the rearrangement junctions will also be compared particularly to examine the
        complexity of the rearrangement, sequence contexts of breaks, presence of repeats and overlapping
        microhomology of the rearrangement. Each of these indices may provide clues to the way large
        radiation doses induce DNA double strand breaks and how they are repaired.</p>

        platform data, to ultimately provide more comprehensive data-sets for downstream
        applications/analyses.<br><br>We have been working with Dr C Maenhauts group to develop the
        methodology to integrate her published Affymetrix gene expression data with our own Illumina RNA-seq
        data from papillary thyroid cancers. We propose now to subject surplus material from the samples
        that Dr Maenhaut received from the CTB (project 002/2007) to RNA-seq in order to not only obtain
        additional expression data over and above that obtained by microarray but also to further validate
        our methodologies.<br><br><a href="#">Go to top</a></p>

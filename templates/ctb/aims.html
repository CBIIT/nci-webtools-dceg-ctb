                <p><strong>The CTB (Chernobyl Tissue Bank) is a unique venture. It is the first international
                    cooperation that seeks to establish a collection of biological samples from tumours and normal
                    tissues from patients for whom the aetiology of their disease is known - exposure to radioiodine in
                    childhood.</strong></p>
                <p>The project, which started in October 1998, has been supported by a number of sponsors including the
                    European Commission, the WHO, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the USA and the Sasakawa Health
                    Foundation of Japan (SHF). The project is currently jointly funded by the NCI and the SHF.</p>
                <p>The project is coordinated from Imperial College, London and works with Institutes in the Russian
                    Federation (the Medical Radiological Research Centre in Obninsk) and Ukraine (the Institute of
                    Endocrinology and Metabolism in Kiev) to support local scientists and clinicians to manage and run a
                    tissue bank for those patients who have developed thyroid tumours following exposure to radiation
                    from the Chernobyl accident. Belarus was also initially included in the project, but is currently
                    suspended for political reasons.</p>
                <p>The project has the full support of the Governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine.</p>
                <p>The large number of thyroid tumours that have occurred in areas exposed to high levels of fallout
                    from the Chernobyl accident raises important problems in the areas of public health, regulation of
                    exposure to radionuclides and in the understanding of the molecular changes involved in their
                    genesis. The over-riding priority must go to matters such as diagnosis, treatment of those affected,
                    and prevention. International Agencies have given and are giving financial and material help in
                    these areas.</p>
                <p>However, providing the needs of the patient are not compromised, it is very important to ensure that
                    information that may be of value to the health of future generations is not lost. Although the post
                    Chernobyl thyroid tumours are associated with a particular aetiology, they may also provide clues to
                    the pathogenesis and molecular biology of thyroid carcinoma in general.</p>

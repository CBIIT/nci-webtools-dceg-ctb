    <p><strong>The main objective of this project is to provide a research resource for both ongoing and future
        studies of the health consequences of the Chernobyl accident.</strong></p>
    <p>The project seeks to maximize the amount of information obtained from small pieces of tumor by providing multiple
        aliquots
        of RNA and DNA extracted from well documented pathological specimens to researchers world-wide and to conserve
        this valuable material for future generations of scientists. It exists to promote collaborative, rather than
        competitive, research on a limited biological resource.</p>
    <h5>The project:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>ensures that the best possible diagnostic service is provided to patients and that appropriate ethical
            consent is obtained for each biological sample
        </li>
        <li>ensures that specimens of thyroid cancer operated on or after 1st October 1998 (the start date of the
            project) are properly described and sampled, and that materials (frozen tissue, fixed tissue sections,
            extracted DNA/RNA and blood samples), are available for appropriate research studies
        </li>
        <li>provides a diagnosis agreed by internationally recognized pathologists. The diagnosis is made available
            to research groups carrying out molecular biological, therapeutic, epidemiological and other studies
        </li>
        <li>provides an archive of data generated from research studies carried out using the material that can be
            used for future studies. This may have direct relevance to both prognosis and assessment of health risks
            from exposure to radiation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thyroid cancer is increasing world-wide and although most tumors do not have a defined radiation etiology, it is
        likely that the insights gained from studying the post Chernobyl tumors will provide information that could be
        of use for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer and of other cancers in general.</p>
    <p><strong>What happens to the results of the research studies?&nbsp;</strong><br>Researchers who
        obtain material from the CTB agree to provide the results of their
        investigation on a case-by-case basis. This information will not be used until after the researchers have
        published their findings, but it will allow the results of all of the studies to be combined to address novel
        research questions in the future. The provision of extracted nucleic acid from thyroid tissue, rather than each
        researcher being provided with a small piece of tissue maximizes the amount of data that can potentially be
        obtained from a single operative specimen and will enable multiple molecular biological studies to be carried
        out for each case.</p>
    <p>The CTB biosample search facility allows researchers wishing to access biomaterials to
        select those cases from which they would wish to receive samples. This search facility includes information on
        the specimen type, patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and, for certain tumor specimens, the driver
        mutation(s) identified to date.</p>
    <p><strong>Where is the CTB located?</strong><br/>The tissue bank is situated iat the Institute of Endocrinology and
        Metabolism in Kiev, Ukraine . The bank consents patients and prepares and stores material from its own
        population. Historically, a separate bank was maintained in Russia. Contributing banks bank maintain their own
        databases of samples and data that are shared into an integrated database maintained at the coordinating center,
        allowing Key information is therefore available to researchers wishing to use the tissue banks as well as each
        institute retaining access to the complete data from its own population at any time.</p>
    <p><strong>Study cohort</strong><br>The CTB currently includes material and information from all patients with
        thyroid carcinomas and cellular follicular adenomas from the contaminated oblasts of Ukraine (Kiev, Kiev city,
        Cherkasse, Chernigov, Rovno, Zhitomyr and Sumy) who were born after 26th April 1967 (i.e. aged under 19 at the
        time of the Chernobyl accident) and operated on or after the 1st October 1998. Detailed standard operating
        procedures for the collection and documentation of specimens and blood samples have been agreed with
        professional staff involved in the collection of material, and ethical standards agreed upon with the relevant
        authorities, conforming to the requirements of each country involved, including those of the funding
        organizations.</p>
    <p>Each specimen is given a unique identifier authorized by the appropriate person responsible for
        the management of the resource. The age, sex, age at operation, oblast, and a measured or calculated dose
        received are recorded for each specimen stored in the CTB, and are made available to researchers with approved
        projects receiving material from the bank. All data accessible by researchers are anonymized. Each anonymized
        specimen is assigned a tissue bank reference number by the institute in Ukraine and all data accessible by
        researchers are identified by this reference number.</p>

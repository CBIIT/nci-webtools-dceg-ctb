                <p>The study cohort includes all those who were resident in the areas of Ukraine and Russia contaminated
                    by radioactive fallout from the accident and who were aged under 19 at exposure (i.e. born after
                    26<sup>th</sup> April 1967). Thyroid cancer in those who were children or adolescents at exposure is
                    the only cancer to have shown a substantial increase in these areas and it is clearly related to
                    exposure to radioiodine (predominantly the short lived isotopes particularly <sup>131</sup>I, which
                    has a half life of 8.1 days). This is evidenced by the sharp decrease in the frequency of thyroid
                    cancer (returning to pre-accident levels) in those who were born after 1/1/87 and were therefore not
                    exposed to radioiodine either in utero (the thyroid concentrates iodine from 3 months of
                    intrauterine age) or in childhood. The cohort now includes a significant number of cases of thyroid
                    tumours from patients who are resident in the areas&nbsp; contaminated by fallout from Chernobyl,
                    but by virtue of the fact that they were born after 1/1/87 have not been exposed to radioiodine.&nbsp;
                    This is an extremely valuable cohort that serves as a control population for thyroid cancer
                    associated with radioiodine exposure.</p>
                <p>The CTB collects a variety of different types of biospecimen from patients undergoing operations for
                    thyroid cancer or adenoma in the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism in Kiev, Ukraine and the
                    A. Tsyb Medical Radiological Research Centre in Obninsk, Russian Federation who consent to donate to
                    the project. Tissue is collected to an approved standard operating procedure (SOP) and is snap
                    frozen; the presence or absence of tumour is verified by frozen section. A representative paraffin
                    block is also obtained for each case. Where appropriate, we also collect fresh and paraffin-embedded
                    tissue from loco-regional metastases.</p>
                <p>Histological slides from all tumours are reviewed by the CTB Pathology Panel - an international group
                    of expert thyroid pathologists, and a consensus diagnosis agreed before any materials are released
                    to researchers.</p>
                <p>The CTB provides materials and data to research groups worldwide. The aim of the project is to ensure
                    that the maximum amount of information can be gathered from what is a unique and limited resource.
                    The surgical samples of thyroid tissue are generally small, therefore the CTB does not currently
                    issue tissue, but provides extracted nucleic acids, paraffin sections and sections from tissue
                    microarrays prepared from this material. Researchers are required to return research data to the CTB
                    so that the information can be shared with other researchers and could lead to better patient care
                    and assessment of risk from radiation exposure to a young population in the future.</p>

                    potential applicant to review whether samples or data matching the researchers search criteria are
                    available in the CTB. The table below provides a summary of the cumulative total of cases from
                    Ukraine and the Russian Federation, which have been reviewed by the Pathology Panel and a consensus

                    and therefore exposed to radioiodine at 3 months of intrauterine age or older. A total of 17% were
                    born after 1<sup>st</sup> December 1986 and therefore not exposed to radioiodine in fallout.</p>

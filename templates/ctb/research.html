                        a proposal via the online application system, accessed through the search function. Researchers
                        can refine their search by sample type and/or data required and obtain an instant report on the
                        availability of samples and data that match the search criteria. Interested researchers can
                        submit a request for data and materials using an application form and entering key information
                        on the research question, study design, laboratory and analytic methods, as well as researcher
                        qualifications. View a sample application here.

                        results that complement other studies. Projects which have used or are using CTB materials are

                                beyond the CTB without the agreement of the Principal Investigator. The aim of the CTB

                                and researchers are therefore required to submit their research data back to the CTB.

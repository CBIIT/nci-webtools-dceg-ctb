                                                        occurring and radiation induced. We have recently found that

                                                    Oligonucleotide GeneChips were used to analyse gene expression

                                                    two-fold increase and 2,000 genes showing at least two-fold decrease

                                                    noted in a high incidence of PTCs. However, the activation of this
                                                    oncogene is found at all stages from benign through

                                                    Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine malignancies and the

                                                    majority of them are papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). Several

                                                    abnormalities, including Ras mutations and RET/PTC rearrangements

                                                    been well characterized in these cancers. Recently, we and several

                                                    groups have reported the BRAF mutation in PTC with a high
                                                    prevalence. We

                                                        Chernobyl thyroid cancers represent a unique resource in

                                                        and radiation biology. They appear in a cohort of patients
                                                        irradiated at the same time and in which there is no doubt that

                                                        cancer originated from radiation exposure. The precise timing of

                                                        course allows to follow precisely the kinetics of appearance of

                                                        High copy-number gene amplification is known to take place at a

                                                        high-resolution copy-number profiles that enable the detection

                                                        shown in a small pilot study that pediatric thyroid carcinoma in

                                                        accident (the Bryansk Oblast) exhibits gene amplification at a

                                                        suggests
                                                        that exposure to ionizing radiation from the environment may be

                                                        gene amplification may represent a radiation signature that
                                                        could be
                                                        used to map amplicons likely to harbor participating oncogenes.

                                                        human DNA that are susceptible to radiation-induced

                                                        These genomic targets are unlikely to be saturated by the doses

                                                        each case should therefore be directly proportional to radiation

                                                        Genetic damage following radiation exposure is subject to
                                                        correction
                                                        by the caretaker systems of DNA repair. Our interest is in the
                                                        role
                                                        that these systems may play in the molecular pathogenesis of
                                                        cancer.
                                                        We propose a pilot project to assess the influence of genetic
                                                        variation on cancer risk following exposure to ionising
                                                        radiation.
                                                        This will be achieved by investigation of variation in the genes
                                                        involved in the DNA repair pathways, in DNA derived from blood
                                                        samples or normal tissue samples from patients with thyroid
                                                        tumors
                                                        of radiation-associated and non-radiation-associated etiology.
                                                        There
                                                        are two main justifications for such a study, first to identify
                                                        SNPs
                                                        which indicate possession of an at risk genotype, and secondly,
                                                        to
                                                        identify the genes in which genetic variation is a significant
                                                        modulator of cancer risk. This has particular and wider
                                                        relevance to
                                                        the involvement of DNA repair-associated factors in the
                                                        pathology of
                                                        other cancers as well, such as breast cancer.

                                                        It is proposed to study chromosomal imbalances in post-Chernobyl
                                                        papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) by means of array CGH using

                                                        BAC arrays. As derived from interphase FISH experiments RET/PTC
                                                        rearrangements are heterogeneously distributed within tumor

                                                        leading to the assumption that additional gene alterations may

                                                        an important role in these tumors. To address this question
                                                        post-Chernobyl PTC, with and without RET/PTC rearrangements,

                                                        RET/PTC-positive (RET/PTC3) and 10 RET/PTC-negative cases with
                                                        similar histological features, a comparable age range of

                                                        Gene expression has received less attention than the role of
                                                        germline polymorphisms or somatic mutations in studies of
                                                        radiation
                                                        and thyroid cancer. The increase in papillary thyroid cancers
                                                        (PTC)
                                                        in exposed children following the Chernobyl nuclear accident
                                                        presents an opportunity to pursue the role of gene expression
                                                        further. Recently, we reported on expression of seven genes,
                                                        each of
                                                        which was able to distinguish post-Chernobyl PTCs from sporadic
                                                        PTCs
                                                        (Port et al 2007). Our approach involved (i) a whole genome
                                                        microarray used for screening purposes; and (ii) quantitative
                                                        examination of the 92 target genes with a high throughput
                                                        RTQ-PCR
                                                        technique (LDA). The study had some limitations such as the
                                                        origin
                                                        of sporadic PTCs (Eastern Germany), their different age at
                                                        diagnosis
                                                        and a small number of cases (n=11). Subsequently another group
                                                        has
                                                        reported on expression of thirteen genes involved in homologous

                                                        post-Chernobyl PTCs (Detours et al 2007). Using the already

                                                        Radiation exposure is a well established risk factor for thyroid
                                                        cancer. Ionising radiation is known to cause extensive DNA
                                                        damage
                                                        including double strand breaks, which may lead to the generation
                                                        of
                                                        somatic mutations in thyroid cells and cancer initiation.
                                                        However,
                                                        environmental triggers cannot fully explain the inter-patient
                                                        heterogeneity in the individual response to exposure to

                                                        which points to the existence of genetic variations that define

                                                        individual susceptibility to radiation-related cancer. We
                                                        propose to

                                                        analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Ukrainian

                                                        cancer-free individuals to identify mutations and SNPs that are
                                                        involved in genetic predisposition and to identify the genes
                                                        that
                                                        are affected. We will then perform functional analysis to find
                                                        whether these genetic variations alter gene function. We will

                                                        fusion oncogenes, resulting in aberrant expression and

                                                        RET, and less frequently of NTRK and BRAF. Altogether, ~60% of

                                                        abnormalities. The discovery of novel somatic rearrangements

                                                        population: 2 with a known rearrangement in RET, NTRK or BRAF
                                                        (as
                                                        positive controls), and 4 without. We will construct 3kb insert
                                                        Illumina libraries from each tumor DNA sample, and ~35bp of

                                                        approximate to 30-fold physical coverage, allowing detection of
                                                        essentially all rearrangements present in the dominant clone of
                                                        the
                                                        cancer. Rearrangements will be processed using a suite of
                                                        informatics tools to predict which may generate an in-frame

                                                        gene. RNA from each of the samples will then be tested by
                                                        exon-exon
                                                        PCR to determine whether the fusion is expressed, and based on
                                                        its
                                                        predicted function, whether it may correspond to a driver
                                                        mutation.
                                                        The number of rearrangements in each cancer and their
                                                        architecture
                                                        will then be compared between the two classes. Sequences at the
                                                        rearrangement junctions will also be compared particularly to
                                                        examine the complexity of the rearrangement, sequence contexts
                                                        of

                                                        rearrangement. Each of these indices may provide clues to the

                                                        we found that a gain of the chromosome band 7q11 was associated

                                                    The constituted network to realise this program involved two teams
                                                    well known in diagnosis and treatment of thyroid tumors and one team
                                                    which were already implicated in the search of radiation-induced
                                                    signatures in the thyroid and in the identification of the molecular
                                                    mechanisms of radiation-induced tumorigenesis. To date, we focused
                                                    our approach at the transcriptomic level. We wish now to analyse
                                                    miRNA and mRNA deregulations in a series of post-Chernobyl thyroid
                                                    tumors by microarray analysis: 1) to identify a radiation-induced
                                                    miRNA and mRNA signatures. We will assess the robustness of these
                                                    signatures for a potential use as a diagnostic tool alone or in
                                                    combination. 2) to obtain an integrated miRNA/mRNA overview of
                                                    radiation-induced tumorigenesis by taking advantage of the
                                                    deregulated pathway identified by the transcriptomic approach. To
                                                    date, no such integrated analysis has been performed as most of the
                                                    studies focused on either transcriptome analysis or miRNA analysis
                                                    separately. Ultimately, we will cross the obtained data with others

                                                        Cancer is a genetic disease, a concept which has been
                                                        consistently
                                                        observed for all tumors. Our approach is to survey the entire
                                                        genome
                                                        of these tumors to look for mutations and other perturbations
                                                        that
                                                        are involved in radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma
                                                        (RI-PTC) and create a genomic profile of this tumor. A new
                                                        technology, termed Next-generation sequencing allows sequencing
                                                        of
                                                        the entire human genome in 8 days. We will begin by sequencing
                                                        the
                                                        DNA of 50 individual RI-PTC tumors from Chernobyl pediatric
                                                        patients
                                                        to look for mutations in genes. We will correlate this data with
                                                        RNA
                                                        sequencing from the same patient samples. This data will provide
                                                        information about events that are taking place at the level of
                                                        gene
                                                        expression, providing information about over and under expressed
                                                        genes and the expression of aberrant genes, and gene fusion
                                                        products. This data will be compared to RIP-PTC in age matched
                                                        patients who were not exposed to radiation to develop a
                                                        radiation-specific profile. We have bioinformatic specialists in

                                                        will provide a comprehensive profile of RIP-PTC.</p>

                                                        Integrative analysis combines heterogeneous biological data, be
                                                        it experimental (e.g., copy number, gene expression, microRNA
                                                        expression) or from the biological literature (e.g., gene
                                                        annotation, pathway information). Integration of data from
                                                        multiple sources is imperative for a mechanistic understanding
                                                        of cancer. By putting together partial views of a complex
                                                        process like tumorgenesis, we may obtain a more accurate and
                                                        complete picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying it. No

                                                        data is available. We therefore aim to develop statistical
                                                        models from the experimental data of these biological processes.
                                                        Such models will enhance our ability to identify biomarkers and
                                                        therapeutic targets more unambiguously and to interpret genotype
                                                        information. This should enhance the understanding of what
                                                        distinguishes the exposed from the non-exposed thyroid cancers.
                                                        In addition, the biological insight these models provide is

                                                        It has long been accepted that cancers arise by the sequential
                                                        accumulation of errors in the DNA of a clone of cells within a
                                                        given tissue. This in part explains their long latency. However,
                                                        recent studies using whole genome sequencing have suggested a
                                                        different mechanism for some cancers, particularly those that
                                                        arise in children. This mechanism is called chromothripsis and
                                                        involves shattering of chromosomes and then restitching them
                                                        together. This results in multiple small changes in the DNA that
                                                        occur simultaneously rather than sequentially. The aim of this
                                                        study is to use whole genome sequencing to identify novel
                                                        mutations in radiation induced thyroid cancer, to identify
                                                        changes in the mitochondrial genome and to investigate the
                                                        frequency of chromothripsis in childhood thyroid cancer,

                                                        shown strong correlation between absorbed doses of IR and the
                                                        induction of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Specific genetic
                                                        alterations, such as rearrangements of the RET oncogene, are
                                                        linked to previous exposure to radioiodine. Recently,

                                                        been found to be selectively expressed in papillary thyroid

                                                        patients lacking radiation exposure. In PTC, ALK rearrangements

                                                        Chernobyl Tissue Bank (CTB) could further our understanding of
                                                        the molecular mechanisms of radiation carcinogenesis in humans
                                                        based on careful evaluation of epidemiological risk factors and
                                                        genomic alterations. Previously, we had reported a preliminary
                                                        study of dose-related alterations in gene expression and
                                                        chromosomal translocations in approximately 70 cases drawn from
                                                        the Ukrainian-American (UkrAm) cohort component of the CTB
                                                        biorepository. Recently, we have completed a pilot study in
                                                        which we have conducted a comprehensive genomic characterization
                                                        of 12 UkrAm cases, including paired fresh frozen and
                                                        formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples using the
                                                        infrastructure and analytical pipeline of the Cancer Genome
                                                        Atlas (TCGA) of the U.S.A. National Cancer Institute (NCI). This
                                                        includes whole genome sequence analysis of RNA, DNA and
                                                        micro-RNAs as well SNP and methylation microarrays of the tumor
                                                        tissue. SNP microarray and DNA analysis was performed on
                                                        peripheral blood for comparison of germline to somatic
                                                        alterations. The success of the feasibility study establishes a
                                                        strong scientific basis for extending this approach to a
                                                        substantially larger study of thyroid cancer cases drawn from
                                                        the CTB. Here, we propose conducting a comprehensive genomic
                                                        characterization study of 500 papillary thyroid cancers (PTC)
                                                        from the Ukraine using biological samples, information on
                                                        radiation exposure, and demographic characteristics. The main
                                                        objective of the study is to provide comprehensive, integrated
                                                        characterization of the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic
                                                        landscapes of radiation-related PTC for comparison across a
                                                        spectrum of I-131 exposure as well as a comparison with
                                                        approximately 500 sporadic PTCs available from The Cancer Genome
                                                        Atlas recently published in Cell. The proposed study has the
                                                        potential to provide unique insights into the mechanisms of
                                                        radiation carcinogenesis and to generate a rich data resource

                                                        We will first identify driver mutations in the primary tumor by
                                                        performing Ion Torrent Oncomine Pan-Cancer assay analysis using
                                                        DNA/RNA extracted from tumor. Next, we will employ the same

                                                        of the same patient. We expect to show that in patients with

                                                        abnormalities using the digital PCR technique. To do so, we will
                                                        examine the presence of specific driver mutation(s) in primary
                                                        tumor by dPCR, and determine the mutant/wild copy numbers in

                                                        of oncogenic proteins by immunohistochemistry, and by evaluation

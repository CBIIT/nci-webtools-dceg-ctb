    <h4><a id="one" class="anchor-section pt-5"></a>1. What is the CTB?</h4>
    <p>The CTB is an international cooperation to establish banks of biomaterial from and information on patients who
        were exposed as children or adolescents to fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident. It also houses research
        data derived by researchers using the CTB biomaterials, in a web accessible data warehouse. Funds to support the
        bank were historically provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the USA and the Sasakawa Health
        Foundation
        of Japan. The Coordinating Centre for the project was previously based at Imperial College, London, UK and is
        currently based at NCI, USA.</p>
    <p>The project commenced collection of material on 1<sup>st</sup> October 1998. It is designed to promote
        collaboration and avoid wasteful competition in the use of limited and very scientifically important resources.
    </p>
    <p>The objectives of the project are to provide an internationally supported research resource for both
        ongoing and future studies of the health consequences of the Chernobyl accident. It aims to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that specimens of thyroid cancer operated on or after 1<sup>st</sup> October 1998 (the
            start date of the project) are consistently described and sampled, and that the materials
            (extracted tumor and normal DNA/RNA and blood samples and in some cases fixed tissue sections)
            together with the relevant information, are available for appropriate research studies.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a diagnosis agreed by an international committee of pathologists for all cases in the CTB. The
            diagnosis will be made available to research groups carrying out molecular biological, therapeutic,
            epidemiological and other studies.
        </li>
        <li>Ensure that knowledge pertaining to the consequences of this accident may benefit the
            patients involved, or mankind in general, and be of value in responding to future nuclear
            accidents.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a id="two" class="anchor-section pt-5"></a>2. What types of material and information are available from the
        CTB?
    </h4>
    <p>The bank includes material and information from patients with thyroid carcinomas and cellular adenomas from the
        contaminated oblasts of Ukraine who were born after
        26<sup>th</sup> April 1967 (i.e. aged under 19 at the time of the Chernobyl accident) and operated
        on or after 1<sup>st</sup> October 1998. The tissue bank is located at the V.P. Komisarenko Institute of
        Endocrinology (IEM) and Metabolism of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine in Kiev, Ukraine.
        Detailed standard operating procedures for the collection, documentation and storage of specimens and blood
        samples have been agreed with professional staff involved in the collection of material. Ethical standards,
        conforming to the requirements of the country involved, including those of the funding organizations have been
        agreed with the relevant authorities.</p>
    <p>The Standard Operating Procedures for the collection of information and material have been approved by the
        relevant Institutional Review Boards. Each specimen is given a code authorized by the appropriate person
        responsible for the management of the bank. The
        age, sex, age at operation (complying with the HIPAA regulations), oblast and country of residence,
        and a calculated measurement of dose received, is recorded for each specimen stored in the bank and
        made available to researchers with approved projects receiving material from the bank, together with
        the review agreed by the international panel of pathologists.</p>
    <p>Frozen aliquots of DNA and RNA extracted from normal and neoplastic thyroid tissue and DNA extracted
        from blood, are available. A frozen section is taken from each portion of tissue before extraction
        to verify its nature. Quality control is performed on nucleic acid extracted from all tissues and blood samples.
        In addition, sections from paraffin sections and from sections of tissue microarrays are available.</p>

    <h4><a id="three" class="anchor-section pt-5"></a>3. Who can obtain material and/or research data from the CTB?</h4>
    <p>The biomaterials available to the international scientific community comprise samples of extracted
        DNA and RNA from tissue, DNA from blood, samples of serum, paraffin embedded sections and tissue
        microarrays. It is not the aim of the project to restrict supply of material to researchers, but to
        coordinate and monitor the use of this unique resource in order to ensure that the maximum possible
        information can be obtained from a limited supply of material.</p>
    <div class="mb-5"><a href="#"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up"></i> Back to the top</a></div>
    <h4><a id="four" class="anchor-section pt-5"></a>4. How do researchers apply?</h4>
    <p>Researchers who are interested in using material, information or research data from the CTB for research purposes
        must complete a brief proposal that includes information on the study design and justification
        for their requirements for materials and/or data. Researchers can first check whether there are sufficient
        samples that fit the criteria for their study by using the Biosample Search Facility. An online application can
        be submitted after performing their Biosample Search. Applications are approved by an External Review Panel that
        ensures that the samples are used in the best scientific research by bona fide researchers.</p>
    <p>No charge is made for samples of nucleic acid, but researchers must be prepared to pay appropriate expenses for
        shipment of specimens or any additional costs. The CTB does not provide funding for research projects.</p>
    <div class="mb-5"><a href="#"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up"></i> Back to the top</a></div>
    <h4><a id="five" class="anchor-section pt-5"></a>5. How are requests evaluated?</h4>
    <p>Requests are evaluated for scientific merit and appropriate use of CTB resources. Projects may be submitted at
        any time and the review procedures are, in most cases, completed by email.</p>
    <div class="mb-5"><a href="#"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up"></i> Back to the top</a></div>
    <h4><a id="six" class="anchor-section pt-5"></a>6. What are the criteria for evaluation and review of applications?
    </h4>
    <p>Criteria have been established to ensure that valid, productive and equitable scientific use is made
        of the CTB resources for multidisciplinary and international studies on post Chernobyl thyroid
        cancer. Approval for a project may be subject to the development of appropriate collaborative links.</p>
    <p>Researchers applying for CTB resources must provide evidence that the following criteria are
        satisfied:</p>
    <ol>
